LOINC 54814-9 'Seizure disorder or epilepsy during assessment period' is the best match because it directly captures both conditions (seizures and epilepsy) as a clinical assessment item, which aligns with a health history or screening context. LOINC 45424-9 (Epilepsy) and 45662-4 (Seizure disorder) are close alternatives but are separate codes for each condition rather than combined. The FACIT codes (70334-8, 70339-7) are symptom-specific temporal questions about recent seizure experiences, not general condition screening.",

While these NHL codes specify summer rather than winter and focus on sun exposure specifically, they capture the same core concept: time spent outdoors measured in hours on a typical day. The other candidates measure indoor activities (88401-5), garden/yard activities (88399-1), or internet use (103846-2), which are less relevant. I selected 63830-4 (weekend day) over 63829-6 (weekday) arbitrarily since neither perfectly matches and the original question doesn't specify day type. Confidence is moderate because the season mismatch (summer vs winter) and the sun exposure focus vs general outdoor time represent meaningful conceptual differences.",
